# Polynom

* There is a detailed description in wiki about all the functions that exist
* Summary of the project 
In this project we implemented and represent monom and polynom as list of monoms. The Monom is represent in the shape of ax^b where a is real number and b is an integer (none negative). 
The polynom is represent as list of monoms in the shape of a_1x^b_1+a_2x^b_2+…+a_nx^b_n (x can be capital latter or lower-case latter, can use space between +/- and the power can’t be negative). The polynom has a number of functionalities such as add another polynom or monom, subtract polynom, derivative of the polynom, find the root in a range of x0 and x1, and more. 
1. Class Monom: 
This class represents a simple Monom of shape ax^b. where a is a real number and b is an integer (not negative). 
This class has 2 fields, 2 constructors and 7 methods. 
2. Class Polynom
This class represents a Polynom of shape multiple Monoms: a_1x^b_1+a_2x^b_2+…+a_nx^b_n. 
This class has the functionality to add, subtract, multiply Polynoms and more. 
This class has 1 field, 3 constructors and 19 methods. 
We have used a grid tool for drawing polynomials https://github.com/JiangTianXiang/Grade-12-Calculus-Graphing-Calculator.
 A network package that displays graphical drawing of a polynomial in a given field. Besides, it shows the local extreme points and extremes at the edges by displaying the extreme points in a different color.

3. Class Monom_Comparator: 
This class compare the power of 2 Monoms. 
This class has only 1 method. 
4. Class Test: 
This class test the project and has 1 method.
